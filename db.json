When heart contracts, it pumps blood (containing oxygen and nutrients) out to organs and tissues. Blood pressure is highest when the heart contracts and pushes the blood forward. It is lowest when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. \n\nThe artery walls stretch and then recoil as the blood is pushed out. This push and pull creates a pulsing pressure or wave which travels through arteries at the speed of sound. The highest point of the wave is called systolic blood pressure while the lowest point is called diastolic pressure. \n\nBlood pressure varies from person to person, depending on age, health, and other factors. Generally, lower blood pressures are healthier than higher pressures. Normal blood pressure for an adult is below 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure above this level may increase your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other problems. \n\nThere are many things that can affect blood pressure, including diet, exercise, stress, weight, smoking, and alcohol use. \n\n# What are the causes of high blood pressure?\nThere are many things that can cause high blood pressure including: narrowing or hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), hormones, genetics, being overweight or obese, eating too much salt (sodium), drinking too much alcohol, stress, not enough exercise, and having kidney disease.\n\n#  What are the risk factors for high blood pressure?\n\nThere are a number of risk factors for high blood pressure, including obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Genetics can also play a role in developing hypertension.\n\nHigh blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is important to be aware of the risk factors for high blood pressure and to take steps to reduce your risk of developing this condition.\n\n#  What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\n\nIf you have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, you may not have any symptoms. This is why it's important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\nWhen symptoms do occur, they can include:\n\n· Headache\n· Dizziness\n· Blurred vision\n· Nausea\n· Shortness of breath\nThere are a few things that you can do to help control your blood pressure if it is high. These include:\n\n· Eating a healthy diet\n· Exercising regularly\n· Maintaining a healthy weight\n· Limiting your intake of sodium\n\n#  How can I monitor my own blood pressure at home?\n\nThere are many ways that you can monitor your own blood pressure at home. You can use an automatic blood pressure cuff, which is a device that wraps around your arm and takes a reading automatically. You can also use a manual blood pressure cuff, which you have to pump up yourself.\n\nWhichever method you choose, it's important to take readings at the same time every day and to keep track of them over time. This will help you see any patterns in your blood pressure and whether or not it is changing over time.\n\nIf you are using an automatic cuff, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for taking a reading. Generally, you will need to:\n\nWrap the cuff around your arm so that the bottom of the cuff is just above your elbow and the top of the cuff is two inches below your armpit\n8. Place the index and middle fingers of your other hand on top of the pulse point on your brachial artery (the artery on the inside of your arm, just below your elbow) \n9. Turn on the machine and wait until it beeps\n10. The machine will start inflating the cuff automatically. When it beeps again, this means the cuff has reached its maximum size and it is time to take the reading \n11. The machines then starts deflating the cuff and when it beeps for a third time, this means the reading is complete \n12. Write down both numbers (the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure) that are displayed on the screen\n13. Repeat steps 8-12 for each reading\n\n#  Are there any risks associated with self-monitoring my blood pressure at home?\n\nSelf-monitoring your blood pressure at home is a safe and effective way to manage your blood pressure. It allows you to track your blood pressure readings over time and make changes to your treatment plan as needed.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when self-monitoring your blood pressure at home. First, always use an appropriate sized cuff and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. It is also important to take multiple readings and average them together to get the most accurate reading. If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to speak with your doctor.","source":"_posts/What-is-blood-pressure.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is blood pressure\ndate: 2022-09-17 18:59:27\ncategories:\n- Medicina Saludable\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is blood pressure?\n\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries.

It is a browser-based massively multiplayer online game that was first released in Europe in February of 2017. The game is set in a science fiction world and allows players to control their own space ship, make allies, and battle rivals.\n\nThe game has three different modes: story mode, co-operative mode, and competitive mode. In story mode, players are able to follow a storyline that was written by an award-winning science fiction author. They can also choose to explore the world on their own or with friends in co-operative mode. Competitive mode pits players against each other in timed battles for resources and domination over the map. \n\nPlayers can choose from one of four races in the game: humans, elves, orcs, or undead. They can also choose from one of six classes: fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, wizard, or shaman. Each class has its own unique abilities that allow players to customize their gameplay experience.\n\nThe Wild Stars game is free to play but offers different premium services that players can purchase with real money. These services include things like increased inventory space, bonus experience points, and access to better gear. However, the developers have stated that they will never sell items that give players an advantage over others who do not purchase them. \n\n# What Makes The Wild Stars Game Unique? \nOne of the things that makes the Wild Stars game unique is its use of an award-winning science fiction author's storyline. Players are able to follow the story as it unfolds or explore it on their own. Additionally, each race in the game has its own unique abilities and classes which allow for a great deal of customization. \n\nThe Wild Stars game is also free to play with no purchases required for an advantage over other players. The developers have said that they will never sell items that give players an unfair advantage so all players are on a level playing field. This makes the game fair for all who want to compete and discourages spending money unnecessarily.\n\n#  What is the Wild Stars Free Roulette? \n\nThe Wild Stars free roulette game is a fantastic option for online casino players who are looking for an exciting and engaging experience. The game is based on the traditional roulette game, but it includes some unique and entertaining features that make it stand out from the competition.\n\nOne of the best things about the Wild Stars free roulette game is that it is available to play for free. This means that players can try out the game without having to risk any of their own money. This is a great option for new players who are looking to learn the rules of the game before playing for real money.\n\nAnother great thing about the Wild Stars free roulette game is that it offers a variety of betting options. This allows players to customize their gameplay experience according to their preferences. Additionally, the game offers a wide range of betting limits, making it suitable for both low and high rollers.\n\nFinally, the Wild Stars free roulette game provides players with excellent graphics and sound effects.
