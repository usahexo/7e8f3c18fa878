        <h1 id="What-is-blood-pressure"><a href="#What-is-blood-pressure" class="headerlink" title="What is blood pressure?"></a>What is blood pressure?</h1><p>Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries. When heart contracts, it pumps blood (containing oxygen and nutrients) out to organs and tissues. Blood pressure is highest when the heart contracts and pushes the blood forward. It is lowest when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. </p>
<p>The artery walls stretch and then recoil as the blood is pushed out. This push and pull creates a pulsing pressure or wave which travels through arteries at the speed of sound. The highest point of the wave is called systolic blood pressure while the lowest point is called diastolic pressure. </p>
<p>Blood pressure varies from person to person, depending on age, health, and other factors. Generally, lower blood pressures are healthier than higher pressures. Normal blood pressure for an adult is below 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure above this level may increase your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other problems. </p>
<p>There are many things that can affect blood pressure, including diet, exercise, stress, weight, smoking, and alcohol use. </p>

You can use an automatic blood pressure cuff, which is a device that wraps around your arm and takes a reading automatically. You can also use a manual blood pressure cuff, which you have to pump up yourself.</p>
<p>Whichever method you choose, it’s important to take readings at the same time every day and to keep track of them over time. This will help you see any patterns in your blood pressure and whether or not it is changing over time.</p>
<p>If you are using an automatic cuff, make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for taking a reading. Generally, you will need to:</p>
<p>Wrap the cuff around your arm so that the bottom of the cuff is just above your elbow and the top of the cuff is two inches below your armpit<br>8. Place the index and middle fingers of your other hand on top of the pulse point on your brachial artery (the artery on the inside of your arm, just below your elbow)<br>9. Turn on the machine and wait until it beeps<br>10. The machine will start inflating the cuff automatically. When it beeps again, this means the cuff has reached its maximum size and it is time to take the reading<br>11. The machines then starts deflating the cuff and when it beeps for a third time, this means the reading is complete<br>12. Write down both numbers (the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure) that are displayed on the screen<br>13. Repeat steps 8-12 for each reading</p>
