The decision opens the door for states to authorize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>The case, Murphy v. NCAA, was brought by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and a number of other plaintiffs, who argued that the ban on sports betting violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves for the states all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government.</p>
<p>The Court agreed with this argument, finding that the federal law in question – the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) – unlawfully regulated an activity that is reserved for the states.</p>
<p>In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote: “The anti-commandeering doctrine may sound arcane, but it is simply the expression of a fundamental structural decision about the American Republic…the Constitution protects state sovereignty as a matter of federalism.”</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. In her dissent, Ginsburg argued that PASPA did not violate the Tenth Amendment because it did not compel states to do anything. Rather, it simply prohibited them from taking action on their own.</p>
<p>Governor Murphy praised the Court’s ruling, calling it a “huge victory for New Jersey andfor freedom.” He added: “This ruling will finally allow us to bring much-needed revenue to our state without infringing on the rights of our residents….I am grateful to our talented legal team for their hard work in successfully challenging this unconstitutional law.”</p>
<p>It is still unclear how many states will choose to legalize sports betting in light of Monday’s ruling. However, given that PASPA was found to be unconstitutional, it seems likely that many more states will soon join New Jersey in permitting sports betting within their borders.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Now-Officially-Legal-In-All-50-States"><a href="#Gambling-Now-Officially-Legal-In-All-50-States" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Now Officially Legal In All 50 States"></a>Gambling Now Officially Legal In All 50 States</h1><p>For years, there’s been a big debate going on in the United States about legalizing gambling. But it seems that lawmakers have finally come to a consensus, as gambling is now legal in all 50 states. While this may be great news for gamblers, it could also spell trouble for those who suffer from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling was first proposed by then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt back in 1932. However, it didn’t gain much traction until later on, when Nevada became the first state to legalize gambling in 1931. The momentum continued to build in subsequent years, and by 1978, 10 states had legalized gambling.</p>
<p>But it was really the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 that kicked off the modern era of gambling expansion. This act allowed Native American tribes to open casinos on their reservations, and over the next few decades, more and more states began to legalize gaming.</p>
<p>By 2006, only Utah and Hawaii remained without any form of legalized gambling. But even they would eventually legalize some form of gambling, with Hawaii becoming the last state to do so in 2012. In total, there are now 47 states with commercial casinos and 45 states with some form of legal sports betting.</p>
<p>So what led to this unanimous decision by Congress to legalize gambling? Well, there are a number of factors at play here. For starters, lawmakers feel that gambling can be a major source of revenue for cash-strapped states. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA), the legal US casino industry generated over $40 billion in tax revenue last year.</p>
<p>But beyond just the financial benefits, many lawmakers also see gambling as a personal freedom issue. They believe that adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble, and that it should be up to each individual state to decide if they want to legalize it or not.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s also the issue of morality at play here. Many people see gambling as being no different than other forms of entertainment like movies or TV shows. They believe that people should be free to engage in whatever activities they please as long as they aren’t harming anyone else.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some benefits to legalizing gambling, there are also some potential risks that need to be considered. For one thing, there’s always the risk of addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), nearly 2% of Americans suffer from problem gambling addiction. This can lead to financial ruin for those affected, as well as family strife and even criminal behavior .</p>
<p>In addition, there’s also the risk of money laundering and other forms of fraud . Casinos have long been known as hotbeds for criminal activity , and with billions of dollars flowing through them each year, it’s no wonder why criminals are drawn to them .</p>
<p>So while legalizing gambling may have its benefits, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved too. If you think you may have a problem with gambling addiction , please seek help from a qualified professional .</p>
<h1 id="Huge-Win-For-Sports-Bettors-As-SC-Strikes-Down-Ban"><a href="#Huge-Win-For-Sports-Bettors-As-SC-Strikes-Down-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Huge Win For Sports Bettors As SC Strikes Down Ban"></a>Huge Win For Sports Bettors As SC Strikes Down Ban</h1><p>The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a federal law that barred gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states, giving a major victory to the country’s $150 billion illegal sports betting industry.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the law — which had banned sports betting in all but four states since 1992 — violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which says that powers not specifically given to the federal government belong to the states.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that the law “infringes upon state sovereignty” and constitutes an unconstitutional intrusion into state affairs.</p>
<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.</p>
<p>The decision is a major victory for New Jersey and other states that have been pushing to legalize sports betting as a way to generate new revenue. It is also a big win for casinos and other businesses that have been pushing for years to get rid of the 1992 law, which they argue has stifled economic growth.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association, a casino lobbying group, said in a statement that the ruling would provide “a long overdue modernization of our country’s outdated gambling laws.”</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling could also pave the way for other forms of legalized gambling, including online poker and casino games.</p>
<p>The decision comes at a time when many states are struggling with budget deficits. New Jersey, for example, has been trying to legalize sports betting as a way to help plug its $8 billion budget gap.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Banning-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Banning-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Law Banning Sports Betting"></a>Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Law Banning Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court on Monday struck down a federal law banning most sports betting, in a landmark decision that could open up the multibillion-dollar industry to widespread state-by-state regulation.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the justices declared the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act unconstitutional, invalidating its provisions that prohibit most states from authorizing sports betting. The decision could pave the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting, which analysts say could generate billions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Alito in the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who dissented along with Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy, said the court should have deferred to Congress on the issue.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,”<br> Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority.</p>
<p>The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was a 1992 United States federal law that made it unlawful for any state or other jurisdiction other than Nevada to “sponsor,” “operate,” “ advertise,” “promote,” or “sell” a professional or amateur sports wager.[1] The law did not specifically mention online gambling; however, opponents of online gambling argued that PASPA applied equally to both brick-and-mortar operations and online ones.[2] </p>
<p>On May 14th, 2018 - In a 6-3 ruling - The United States Supreme Court declared The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) unconstitutional stating each state has freedom if they want regulated legalized sports betting within their boarders </p>
<p>This will likely result in billions of dollars in revenue as this was once a multi-billion dollar illegal industry</p>
<h1 id="SC-Ruling-Paves-The-Way-For-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#SC-Ruling-Paves-The-Way-For-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="SC Ruling Paves The Way For Legalized Sports Betting"></a>SC Ruling Paves The Way For Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on Monday that overturned a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. The decision could pave the way for sports betting to be legalized in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting believe that it could help to boost the economy by generating new tax revenue and creating new jobs. They also argue that it would provide a new source of entertainment for fans, and would help to reduce illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased corruption in sport, and could cause problems for people with gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling is seen as a victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting to legalize sports betting since 2011. In 2012, New Jersey passed a law allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but the law was struck down by a federal court. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on Monday.</p>
