It would be like saying that we should all stop playing because the casino has too big of an advantage.</p>
<p>The basic game of blackjack is unbeatable for the player. No matter what the composition of the cards, the house edge is fixed at just under 1 percent provided you stick to basic strategy. But if you add in splitting and surrendering your options increase, as does the house edge.</p>
<p>That said, there are still plenty of players who enjoy playing blackjack without splitting or surrendering. If you fall into this category, I have some good news for you: You can still find a fun and entertaining game of blackjack without giving up any advantage to the casino!</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to take a look at six different blackjack games that don’t require splitting or surrendering. We’ll also take a look at the house edge for each game so that you can see how much better off you are by avoiding these optional plays.</p>
<p>First up is Atlantic City Blackjack. This game is played with eight decks of cards and features dealer peek, which allows the dealer to look at his hole card to see if he has a blackjack. The house edge for Atlantic City Blackjack is 0.39 percent.</p>
<p>Next up is Vegas Strip Blackjack. This game is also played with eight decks of cards and features dealer peek, but it also includes some other rules that make it more advantageous for the player. Specifically, doubling down on any two cards is allowed, and players may split any pair except pairs of 2s through 4s. The house edge for Vegas Strip Blackjack drops down to 0.28 percent.</p>
<p>Third on our list is Double Exposure Blackjack. This game is also played with eight decks of cards, but in Double Exposure Blackjack both dealer cards are dealt face up. This increases the house edge to 1.65 percent.</p>
<p>Fourth up is Spanish 21 Blackjack. Unlike all of the games we’ve looked at so far, Spanish 21 Blackjack is played with only six decks of cards instead of eight decks (or more). This decreases the house edge slightly to 0.46 percent, but it also comes with a few other rules changes that make it more advantageous for the player – namely that players may double down on any number of cards and re-split pairs up to four times (instead of just twice).</p>
<p>Fifth on our list is Super Fun 21 Blackjack. This game is also played with six decks of cards, but like Spanish 21 Blackjack it comes with a few rule changes that make it more favourable for the player; specifically, players can split any pair (even if they are not matched), they can double down on any two cards, and blackjacks pay out at 3-to-2 instead of 1-to-1 . These rule changes decrease the house edge from 0 .64 percent down to 0 .43 percent .</p>
<h1 id="Mark-Twain-Would-Approve-of-This-6-Deck-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Mark-Twain-Would-Approve-of-This-6-Deck-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Mark Twain Would Approve of This 6 Deck Blackjack Strategy!"></a>Mark Twain Would Approve of This 6 Deck Blackjack Strategy!</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, Mark Twain was one of the most well-known and respected American authors of all time. In 1892, he published an article in the Atlantic Monthly entitled “The Science of Gambling” which discussed games of chance such as roulette, faro, and poker. A few years later, in 1907, he published another article in Harper’s Magazine called “CardSharping” which covered cheating methods used by card sharks.</p>
<p>Given Twain’s background and knowledge on the subject matter, it’s no surprise that he would be a big proponent of blackjack strategy. And in fact, he was! In his book “Life on the Mississippi”, he provides a detailed description of how to beat the game using a six deck strategy.</p>
<p>Although times have changed and casino rules have become more complicated, the basic principles underlying Twain’s strategy are still valid today. Let’s take a look at what they are!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always split pairs of Aces and 8s.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never split pairs of 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs of 6s through 10s if the dealer is showing a card worth 10 or more points (e.g., a 3, 4, 5, or 6). Otherwise, keep them together.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer shows an Ace as their upcard, hit if you have 13 points or less; stand if you have 14 points or more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down on 11 points only (never double down with 12 points).</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the dealer has a 2 as their upcard, take insurance if your first two cards total 20 points or more (e.g., Ace-Queen). Insurance pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (a natural).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="No-Surrender-or-Splitting-in-6-Deck-Blackjack-That’s-Still-Fair-Play"><a href="#No-Surrender-or-Splitting-in-6-Deck-Blackjack-That’s-Still-Fair-Play" class="headerlink" title="No Surrender or Splitting in 6 Deck Blackjack? That’s Still Fair Play!"></a>No Surrender or Splitting in 6 Deck Blackjack? That’s Still Fair Play!</h1><p>The game of blackjack pits dealer against player in an effort to get as close to 21 as possible, without going bust. The key to success is making smart decisions during the game, and counting cards can give you an advantage.</p>
<p>While some players advocate for no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack, doing so reduces the chances of a fair game. Keep reading to learn more about why surrendering or splitting in this situation can be a bad decision.</p>
<p>When it comes to playing blackjack, some players advocate for no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack games. However, doing so can actually reduce the chances of having a fair game.</p>
<p>Here’s why: when you surrender or split in this situation, you are essentially giving up your opportunity to win the hand. This can be costly, especially if the dealer has a strong hand.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering or splitting, it’s best to wait for better hands and make smart decisions throughout the course of the game. This will increase your chances of winning and ensure that you have a fair game.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-6-Deck-Blackjack-Without-Splitting-or-SurrenderingStill-Provides-Plenty-of-Excitement"><a href="#Playing-6-Deck-Blackjack-Without-Splitting-or-SurrenderingStill-Provides-Plenty-of-Excitement" class="headerlink" title="Playing 6 Deck Blackjack Without Splitting or SurrenderingStill Provides Plenty of Excitement!"></a>Playing 6 Deck Blackjack Without Splitting or SurrenderingStill Provides Plenty of Excitement!</h1><p>There are a few different variations of blackjack that can be played, but the most popular is the standard game where players are dealt two cards and then must make a decision on what to do with those cards. One option is to stand which means to keep the cards as they are and not receive any more. Another choice is to hit, which means taking another card in order to try and reach a total of 21 or closer to it. If somebody goes over 21, then they have busted and lose automatically. The last option is to split, which is when you are dealt two cards of the same value and can choose to create two hands instead of one. Finally, there is the option of surrendering which can only be done if the player has been dealt two cards of the same value (and not including an Ace).</p>
<p>Surrendering isn’t available in every casino, so if you’re looking for a 6 deck blackjack game that doesn’t let you surrender then don’t worry - there are still plenty of other options out there! For example, some casinos will offer games that allow players to split up to four times (as opposed to just twice in a regular game). This can provide plenty of excitement, especially if your first two cards are both 10s or face cards since you’ll have four chances to win rather than just two.</p>
<p>Another variation on 6 deck blackjack without surrendering that’s becoming increasingly popular is Double Exposure Blackjack. In this game, both dealer’s cards are shown at the beginning of the hand. This essentially gives players a 50/50 chance of winning since they can see what the dealer has and make decisions accordingly. There are other variations out there too, so it’s worth checking out a few different ones before settling on one particular game.</p>
<p>Whichever type of blackjack you choose to play, remember that having fun is always more important than winning or losing money. So relax, enjoy yourself, and good luck!</p>
<h1 id="Enjoy-6-Deck-Blackjack-With-No-Surrender-or-Splitting-If-You-Prefer"><a href="#Enjoy-6-Deck-Blackjack-With-No-Surrender-or-Splitting-If-You-Prefer" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy 6 Deck Blackjack With No Surrender or Splitting If You Prefer"></a>Enjoy 6 Deck Blackjack With No Surrender or Splitting If You Prefer</h1><p>There are different blackjack variations that offer different gameplay experiences. If you’re looking for a variation that doesn’t have surrender or splitting, then 6 deck blackjack is a great option. This game variant is played with 6 decks of cards, which gives players more opportunities to form winning hands.</p>
<p>In order to play 6 deck blackjack, you’ll need to find a table that offers it. Many online casinos offer this game variant, so finding a place to play is not difficult. Once you’ve found a table, take a seat and begin placing your bets. The minimum bet in most casinos will be $5, but this can vary depending on the casino.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. You’ll receive two cards face up, and the dealer will receive two cards - one face up and one face down. You can then choose to hit (take another card), stand (end your turn), or double down (double your bet and receive one more card). If you go over 21, you lose automatically.</p>
<p>Since there is no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack, the best strategy is to always hit until you reach 17 or greater. The only time you would want to stand is if the dealer has a poor upcard (2 through 6). By following this strategy, you’ll give yourself the best chance of winning while minimising the risk of going bust.</p>

<p>The GTO approach takes into account all of the possible outcomes of a particular decision, as well as the probabilities of each outcome happening. It then calculates the best move to make based on all of this information.</p>
<p>While the GTO approach may not always be possible to adhere to in practice, it is still a valuable tool for poker players to understand. By understanding the principles of GTO, players can make better decisions both in individual hands and during strategic game planning.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-GTO-Method-in-Poker"><a href="#What-is-the-GTO-Method-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is the GTO Method in Poker?"></a>What is the GTO Method in Poker?</h1><p>The GTO Method in poker is a strategy for playing the game that is theoretically perfect, or “game-theoretically optimal.” This means that it takes into account all possible actions that could be taken by all players at any point in the hand, and calculates the best possible response to each.</p>
<p>The GTO Method has been developed by advanced poker pros who have dedicated many hours to studying and perfecting the game. It is not something that can be learned overnight, but it is a powerful tool for those who are willing to put in the time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Players using the GTO Method will usually make decisions based on their own odds and outs, rather than on what they think their opponents may be holding. This can be a difficult way to play, as it requires a lot of knowledge and experience, but it can also be very profitable.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of using the GTO Method include:</p>
<ul>
<li>improved decision making ability;</li>
<li>understanding of how different hands work together;</li>
<li>increased ability to read opponents; and</li>
<li>more consistent results in tournaments and cash games.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-is-the-GTO-Strategy-in-Poker"><a href="#What-is-the-GTO-Strategy-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is the GTO Strategy in Poker?"></a>What is the GTO Strategy in Poker?</h1><p>The GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy in poker is a mathematically perfect way to play based on the odds of the game. It takes into account all possible scenarios and outcomes in order to make the most profitable decision at any given point in the game.</p>
<p>Because poker is a game of incomplete information, there is no one ‘right’ way to play each hand. However, by using the GTO strategy as a guideline, you can make sure your decisions are always in line with the best possible option, regardless of what your opponents are doing.</p>
<p>There are many software programs and calculators which can help you to calculate the GTO for any given situation, but it’s also possible to do some of the math yourself if you’re feeling up to it. Here’s an example of how to work out the GTO for a simplified heads-up pot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on your opening range - this is the range of hands you would be willing to open with from any given position. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume that our opening range consists only of pairs and suited connectors (e.g. 6♣7♣).</li>
<li>Assign a value to each hand in your opening range - we’ll use Texas Hold’em equilavent values, where Aces are high and deuces are low. So our opening range would have a value of 16.</li>
<li>Work out what percentage of hands your opponent will have which beat your opening range - this is known as their equity against your range. In our example, we’ll assume that our opponent has an equity of 50% against our range (meaning they will win half the time when they hit their hand). </li>
<li>Multiply the value of each hand in your opening range by its equity against your opponent’s range - this gives us the expected value (EV) for each hand in our opener…<br>6♣7♣(16)x0.50 = 8<br>4♥5♥(13)x0.50 = 6<br>etc…<br>So, overall, our opening range has an EV of 30 (16×1.50+13×1.00+10×0.50).</li>
<li>Choose the hand with the highest EV from within our opening range - in this case, it would be 6♣7♣ as it has an EV of 8 whereas 4♥5♥ has an EV of 6 only. We would therefore choose to open with 6♣7♣ from any position!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-is-the-GTO-Approach-in-Poker"><a href="#What-is-the-GTO-Approach-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is the GTO Approach in Poker?"></a>What is the GTO Approach in Poker?</h1><p>The GTO (game theory optimal) approach in poker is a method of play that takes into account the possible strategies of one’s opponents and the best reaction to each of those strategies. This approach is designed to produce the most profitable outcome over the long run, regardless of what your opponents may do.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, GTO poker relies heavily on game theory – a branch of mathematics that studies how rational decision-makers behaviour under various circumstances. In poker, game theory can be used to determine the best line of action in any given spot, taking into account all possible outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say you hold two hearts and the board shows Q♥ J♣ T♣. If your opponent betting $10 into a $20 pot, you might calculate that they have either two hearts (giving them a straight flush draw) or a queen (giving them two pair). In this spot, it would be correct to fold if your opponent is only playing for value, as they have a better hand than you do. However, if your opponent is bluffing (or trying to semi-bluff), then it would be correct to call as you have the best chance of winning the pot.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to accurately calculate your opponent’s range is no easy task and often requires plenty of practice and experience. However, once you have a good understanding of how your opponents play, GTO poker will give you the best possible chance to make money in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-GTO-Mean-in-Poker-1"><a href="#What-Does-GTO-Mean-in-Poker-1" class="headerlink" title="What Does GTO Mean in Poker?"></a>What Does GTO Mean in Poker?</h1><p>GTO stands for “game theory optimal” and is a term used in poker to describe the best possible play in any given situation, based on mathematical principles. In essence, GTO poker is all about playing the odds as accurately as possible in order to assure the highest possible return on investment.</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to stray from GTO strategy in order to take advantage of an opponent’s weaknesses, this can often lead to disastrous results. Instead, it’s better to stick to the basics and make the most mathematically sound plays possible, even if they don’t always win you the hand outright.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of playing GTO poker is that your opponents will find it incredibly difficult to gain an edge over you. By consistently making the most rational decisions, you will put yourself in a much stronger position overall – no matter what type of game you’re playing.</p>

<p>The case, Murphy v. NCAA, was brought by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and a number of other plaintiffs, who argued that the ban on sports betting violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves for the states all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government.</p>
<p>The Court agreed with this argument, finding that the federal law in question – the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) – unlawfully regulated an activity that is reserved for the states.</p>
<p>In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote: “The anti-commandeering doctrine may sound arcane, but it is simply the expression of a fundamental structural decision about the American Republic…the Constitution protects state sovereignty as a matter of federalism.”</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. In her dissent, Ginsburg argued that PASPA did not violate the Tenth Amendment because it did not compel states to do anything. Rather, it simply prohibited them from taking action on their own.</p>
<p>Governor Murphy praised the Court’s ruling, calling it a “huge victory for New Jersey andfor freedom.” He added: “This ruling will finally allow us to bring much-needed revenue to our state without infringing on the rights of our residents….I am grateful to our talented legal team for their hard work in successfully challenging this unconstitutional law.”</p>
<p>It is still unclear how many states will choose to legalize sports betting in light of Monday’s ruling. However, given that PASPA was found to be unconstitutional, it seems likely that many more states will soon join New Jersey in permitting sports betting within their borders.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Now-Officially-Legal-In-All-50-States"><a href="#Gambling-Now-Officially-Legal-In-All-50-States" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Now Officially Legal In All 50 States"></a>Gambling Now Officially Legal In All 50 States</h1><p>For years, there’s been a big debate going on in the United States about legalizing gambling. But it seems that lawmakers have finally come to a consensus, as gambling is now legal in all 50 states. While this may be great news for gamblers, it could also spell trouble for those who suffer from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling was first proposed by then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt back in 1932. However, it didn’t gain much traction until later on, when Nevada became the first state to legalize gambling in 1931. The momentum continued to build in subsequent years, and by 1978, 10 states had legalized gambling.</p>
<p>But it was really the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 that kicked off the modern era of gambling expansion. This act allowed Native American tribes to open casinos on their reservations, and over the next few decades, more and more states began to legalize gaming.</p>
<p>By 2006, only Utah and Hawaii remained without any form of legalized gambling. But even they would eventually legalize some form of gambling, with Hawaii becoming the last state to do so in 2012. In total, there are now 47 states with commercial casinos and 45 states with some form of legal sports betting.</p>
<p>So what led to this unanimous decision by Congress to legalize gambling? Well, there are a number of factors at play here. For starters, lawmakers feel that gambling can be a major source of revenue for cash-strapped states. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA), the legal US casino industry generated over $40 billion in tax revenue last year.</p>
<p>But beyond just the financial benefits, many lawmakers also see gambling as a personal freedom issue. They believe that adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble, and that it should be up to each individual state to decide if they want to legalize it or not.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s also the issue of morality at play here. Many people see gambling as being no different than other forms of entertainment like movies or TV shows. They believe that people should be free to engage in whatever activities they please as long as they aren’t harming anyone else.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some benefits to legalizing gambling, there are also some potential risks that need to be considered. For one thing, there’s always the risk of addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), nearly 2% of Americans suffer from problem gambling addiction. This can lead to financial ruin for those affected, as well as family strife and even criminal behavior .</p>
<p>In addition, there’s also the risk of money laundering and other forms of fraud . Casinos have long been known as hotbeds for criminal activity , and with billions of dollars flowing through them each year, it’s no wonder why criminals are drawn to them .</p>
<p>So while legalizing gambling may have its benefits, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved too. If you think you may have a problem with gambling addiction , please seek help from a qualified professional .</p>
<h1 id="Huge-Win-For-Sports-Bettors-As-SC-Strikes-Down-Ban"><a href="#Huge-Win-For-Sports-Bettors-As-SC-Strikes-Down-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Huge Win For Sports Bettors As SC Strikes Down Ban"></a>Huge Win For Sports Bettors As SC Strikes Down Ban</h1><p>The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a federal law that barred gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states, giving a major victory to the country’s $150 billion illegal sports betting industry.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the law — which had banned sports betting in all but four states since 1992 — violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which says that powers not specifically given to the federal government belong to the states.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that the law “infringes upon state sovereignty” and constitutes an unconstitutional intrusion into state affairs.</p>
<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.</p>
<p>The decision is a major victory for New Jersey and other states that have been pushing to legalize sports betting as a way to generate new revenue. It is also a big win for casinos and other businesses that have been pushing for years to get rid of the 1992 law, which they argue has stifled economic growth.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association, a casino lobbying group, said in a statement that the ruling would provide “a long overdue modernization of our country’s outdated gambling laws.”</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling could also pave the way for other forms of legalized gambling, including online poker and casino games.</p>
<p>The decision comes at a time when many states are struggling with budget deficits. New Jersey, for example, has been trying to legalize sports betting as a way to help plug its $8 billion budget gap.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Banning-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Banning-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Law Banning Sports Betting"></a>Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Law Banning Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court on Monday struck down a federal law banning most sports betting, in a landmark decision that could open up the multibillion-dollar industry to widespread state-by-state regulation.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the justices declared the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act unconstitutional, invalidating its provisions that prohibit most states from authorizing sports betting. The decision could pave the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting, which analysts say could generate billions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Alito in the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who dissented along with Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy, said the court should have deferred to Congress on the issue.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,”<br> Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority.</p>
<p>The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was a 1992 United States federal law that made it unlawful for any state or other jurisdiction other than Nevada to “sponsor,” “operate,” “ advertise,” “promote,” or “sell” a professional or amateur sports wager.[1] The law did not specifically mention online gambling; however, opponents of online gambling argued that PASPA applied equally to both brick-and-mortar operations and online ones.[2] </p>
<p>On May 14th, 2018 - In a 6-3 ruling - The United States Supreme Court declared The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) unconstitutional stating each state has freedom if they want regulated legalized sports betting within their boarders </p>
<p>This will likely result in billions of dollars in revenue as this was once a multi-billion dollar illegal industry</p>
<h1 id="SC-Ruling-Paves-The-Way-For-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#SC-Ruling-Paves-The-Way-For-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="SC Ruling Paves The Way For Legalized Sports Betting"></a>SC Ruling Paves The Way For Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on Monday that overturned a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. The decision could pave the way for sports betting to be legalized in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting believe that it could help to boost the economy by generating new tax revenue and creating new jobs. They also argue that it would provide a new source of entertainment for fans, and would help to reduce illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased corruption in sport, and could cause problems for people with gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling is seen as a victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting to legalize sports betting since 2011. In 2012, New Jersey passed a law allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but the law was struck down by a federal court. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on Monday.</p>
