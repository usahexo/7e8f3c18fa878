<ul>
<li><p>1-18 or 19-36 - These are the odds for betting on either black or red, odd or even, or high (1-19) or low (20-36) numbers. These bets typically pay out even money, which means that you will get your original wager back plus an additional amount equal to your original wager if you win. For example, if you wager $10 on black and it comes up black, you will receive $10 back plus another $10, for a total return of $20.</p>
</li>
<li><p>1st 12 or 2nd 12 - These bets are for betting on either the first dozen (1-12) or second dozen (13-24) set of numbers on the roulette table. These bets typically pay out 2-1, which means that you will receive twice your original wager if you win. For example, if you wager $10 on first dozen and it comes up as 2nd dozen instead, you would receive $20 back ($10 original stake plus $10 profit).</p>
</li>
</ul>

He wrote some of the most well-known novels in American history, including “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”.</p>
<p>Twain was born on November 30th, 1835 in the small town of Florida, Missouri. He spent his childhood moving around with his family, as his father worked as a riverboat captain. Twain’s early life was filled with adventure and he would often use his experiences as inspiration for his writing.</p>
<p>In 1847, Twain’s family settled in Hannibal, Missouri - which would later become the setting for many of his famous novels. It was here that Twain met Tom Sawyer, a character who would later appear in several of his books.</p>
<p> Twain began writing seriously in the 1860s and soon gained a large following. In 1867, he published his first book - “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County”. The book was a success and established Twain as one of America’s leading writers.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Twain wrote numerous novels, essays and short stories. He was also a successful public speaker and traveled extensively throughout the world.</p>
<p>Despite being one of America’s most famous authors, Twain had a complex personality and often clashed with critics and the media. However, he is now considered to be one of the greatest writers in American history.</p>
<p>Mark Twain died on April 21st, 1910 at the age of 74. His legacy lives on and his works are still enjoyed by readers today.</p>

<p>In 1857, Twain published his first novel, The Innocents Abroad. The book was a humorous account of Twain’s travels through Europe and the Middle East. He followed up this success with several other novels, including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1875) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884).</p>
