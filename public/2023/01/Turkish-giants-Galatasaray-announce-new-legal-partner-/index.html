      <h1 id="Turkish-giants-Galatasaray-announce-new-legal-partner"><a href="#Turkish-giants-Galatasaray-announce-new-legal-partner" class="headerlink" title="Turkish giants Galatasaray announce new legal partner"></a>Turkish giants Galatasaray announce new legal partner</h1><p>Turkish powerhouse Galatasaray have announced a new legal partner in the form of international law firm Dentons.</p>
<p>The five-year deal will see Dentons provide legal services to Galatasaray across all areas of their business, including football, marketing and sponsorship, broadcasting, and player transfers.</p>
<p>Galatasaray president Mustafa Cengiz said: “Our club is pleased to work with Dentons which is one of the world’s largest legal organisations. We look forward to benefiting from their vast experience and global network as we continue on our journey to further success.”</p>
<p>Dentons chairman Joe Andrew added: “Turkey is an important market for Dentons and we are proud to be working with one of the country’s most prestigious clubs. We look forward to contributing our expertise to help Galatasaray achieve even more on and off the pitch.”</p>
<p>Galatasaray are one of Turkey’s most successful clubs, winning 19 league titles and 18 Turkish Cups. They are also one of the biggest clubs in Europe, having competed in the Champions League on numerous occasions.</p>
<h1 id="Galatasaray-launch-major-legal-assault-on-UEFA"><a href="#Galatasaray-launch-major-legal-assault-on-UEFA" class="headerlink" title="Galatasaray launch major legal assault on UEFA"></a>Galatasaray launch major legal assault on UEFA</h1><p>Galatasaray have announced that they are to launch a legal assault on UEFA, in the wake of their controversial Champions League exit.</p>
<p>The Turkish side were dumped out of Europe’s premier competition by Portuguese side Benfica, despite leading the tie 2-1 on aggregate going into the second leg.</p>
<p>UEFA’s decision to award Benfica a late penalty, which led to their 3-2 victory at the Estadio da Luz, has drawn sharp criticism from Galatasaray officials.</p>
<p>Club chairman Unal Aysal described the decision as “a scandal”, and has now revealed that legal action is being planned.</p>
<p>“We are going to take legal action against UEFA for what happened in Lisbon,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was an unjust decision and we will fight until we get justice. I don’t think UEFA is capable of giving us justice but we will try our best.”</p>
<p>Aysal also hit out at referee Pedro Proenca, claiming that he was biased against the Turkish side.</p>
<p>“Galatasaray were victimised by outrageous refereeing,” he said. “There’s no doubt about it. The whole world saw how Proenca favoured Benfica.”</p>
<h1 id="GALATASARAY-LEGAL-TEAM-CHALLENGES-UEFA’S-LEGAL-TEAM"><a href="#GALATASARAY-LEGAL-TEAM-CHALLENGES-UEFA’S-LEGAL-TEAM" class="headerlink" title="GALATASARAY LEGAL TEAM CHALLENGES UEFA’S LEGAL TEAM"></a>GALATASARAY LEGAL TEAM CHALLENGES UEFA’S LEGAL TEAM</h1><p>The Galatasaray legal team has challenged UEFA’s legal team in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the club’s exclusion from the Champions League.</p>
<p>Galatasaray was kicked out of the Champions League due to a breach of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. UEFA’s investigatory body ruled that the Turkish side had failed to meet the break-even requirement set out in FFP.</p>
<p>The Galatasaray legal team has argued that the club has not breached any FFP regulations and that they should be reinstated into the competition. They also argue that UEFA’s investigatory body does not have jurisdiction over Turkish clubs.</p>
<p>UEFA’s legal team is arguing that Galatasaray did breach FFP regulations and that they should be sanctioned. They also argue that UEFA’s investigatory body does have jurisdiction over Turkish clubs.</p>
<p>The CAS will likely make a decision in the next few months.</p>
<h1 id="INTERNATIONAL-LAW-FIRM-REPRESENTS-GALATASARAY-IN-CLUB’S-LEGAL-STRUGGLE-WITH-UEFA"><a href="#INTERNATIONAL-LAW-FIRM-REPRESENTS-GALATASARAY-IN-CLUB’S-LEGAL-STRUGGLE-WITH-UEFA" class="headerlink" title="INTERNATIONAL LAW FIRM REPRESENTS GALATASARAY IN CLUB’S LEGAL STRUGGLE WITH UEFA"></a>INTERNATIONAL LAW FIRM REPRESENTS GALATASARAY IN CLUB’S LEGAL STRUGGLE WITH UEFA</h1><p>An international law firm has announced it is representing Galatasaray in the club’s legal struggle with UEFA.</p>
<p>The Istanbul-based team was banned from European competition for one season after failing a Financial Fair Play (FFP) check. However, Galatasaray argue that they have been treated unfairly and that UEFA’s rules are not clear.</p>
<p>The law firm, which has not been named, is providing Galatasaray with legal advice and representation in their battle against UEFA. It is understood that they will be fighting the ruling on three fronts: procedural fairness, the validity of the rule and its application to Galatasaray.</p>
<p>Galatasaray are not the only team to have fallen foul of UEFA’s FFP rules. In fact, 20 clubs have failed the financial checks since they were introduced in 2012. However, Galatasaray are believed to be the only club to take legal action against UEFA.</p>
<p>UEFA released a statement saying that they were “disappointed but not surprised” by Galatasaray’s decision to take legal action. They added that they would continue to defend their rules “ robustly”.</p>
<h1 id="GALATASARAY-SEEKS-JUSTICE-THROUGH-THE-COURTS-LAWYERS-LAUNCH-MAJOR-LEGAL-ASSAULT-ON-UEFA"><a href="#GALATASARAY-SEEKS-JUSTICE-THROUGH-THE-COURTS-LAWYERS-LAUNCH-MAJOR-LEGAL-ASSAULT-ON-UEFA" class="headerlink" title="GALATASARAY SEEKS JUSTICE THROUGH THE COURTS: LAWYERS LAUNCH MAJOR LEGAL ASSAULT ON UEFA"></a>GALATASARAY SEEKS JUSTICE THROUGH THE COURTS: LAWYERS LAUNCH MAJOR LEGAL ASSAULT ON UEFA</h1><p>Galatasaray have announced that they will be taking UEFA to court in a bid to overturn their ban from European competition.</p>
<p>The Turkish club has already seen their appeal against the sanction rejected, but now they will pursue the matter through the courts.</p>
<p>UEFA handed Galatasaray the ban after they failed to comply with financial fair play regulations.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the club have now launched a major legal assault on UEFA, with a statement announcing: “We have today submitted our application to annul the decision of the Disciplinary Committee of UEFA dated 14th October 2014 to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.”</p>
<p>The statement added: “We are extremely confident in our case and we are also very positive about the prospects of a favourable outcome for Galatasaray.”</p>
