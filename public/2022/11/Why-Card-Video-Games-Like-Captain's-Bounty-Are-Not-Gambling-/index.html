However, games such as Captain’s Bounty are not considered gambling because the outcome of the game is based on the player’s skills and not chance.</p>
<p>In Captain’s Bounty, players compete to collect sets of cards that earn them points. The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the game. This type of game is known as a “point-based game” and is not considered gambling because the outcome is based on the player’s skills and not chance.</p>
<p>Other examples of point-based games include checkers, chess, and Scrabble. In all of these games, the winner is determined by the player’s skills, not chance. This is why these games are not considered gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Captain’s-Bounty-a-non-gambling-card-video-game"><a href="#Captain’s-Bounty-a-non-gambling-card-video-game" class="headerlink" title="Captain’s Bounty a non-gambling card video game"></a>Captain’s Bounty a non-gambling card video game</h1><p>The rules are simple. There are two decks of cards, one with just captains and one with just crews. The players take turns flipping over cards from their deck. If a player flips over a captain, they claim that card and set it in front of them. If they flip over a crew, they put it back in the deck. Once one player flips over all of their captains, they win!</p>
<p>Some people like to play with more than two people, adding an extra deck of cards. In this case, each person flips over two cards at a time and the first person to flip over all their captains wins!</p>
<h1 id="Why-card-video-games-like-Captain’s-Bounty-dodge-gambling-classification"><a href="#Why-card-video-games-like-Captain’s-Bounty-dodge-gambling-classification" class="headerlink" title="Why card video games like Captain’s Bounty dodge gambling classification"></a>Why card video games like Captain’s Bounty dodge gambling classification</h1><p>While popular card video games like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105228/captains-bounty">Captain’s Bounty</a> sometimes blur the lines between what is considered gambling and skill-based games, developers purposefully avoid specific classification to keep these titles available in a wider range of markets. </p>
<p>Gambling is often restricted or banned in certain countries or locales, so studios that design card games specifically for moneymaking purposes may need to tailor their products accordingly. However, by dodging specific categorization, these studios can open up their games to a larger audience who might not have access to traditional casino-style gambling activities. </p>
<p>This method also allows these studios to sidestep any potential criticism that their products are little more than gambling in disguise. In some cases, it can even be used as a marketing tool; by avoiding the “gambling” label, these studios can position their games as family-friendly alternatives to more risqué pastimes. </p>
<p>This isn’t to say that all card video games are devoid of gambling elements - many titles include mechanics that allow players to bet on matches or races for in-game items or currency. However, by avoiding classification as an actual gambling activity, these games can circumvent any legal issues and allow players from around the world to enjoy them without restriction.</p>
<h1 id="Classification-avoided-for-card-video-game-Captain’s-Bounty"><a href="#Classification-avoided-for-card-video-game-Captain’s-Bounty" class="headerlink" title="Classification avoided for card video game Captain’s Bounty"></a>Classification avoided for card video game Captain’s Bounty</h1><p>The skill of video game classification by publishers and developers is often an elusive one. Games that could easily fit into a certain genre may be purposely left out to prevent preconceptions of how the game will play out for players. This proved unsuccessful for the card game Captain’s Bounty, which left its players feeling lost and without any sense of direction. </p>
<p>Developed by BitBucket Games, Captain’s Bounty is a digital reimagining of the physical card game released in 2014. The objective of the game is to collect as many treasure cards as possible and defeat your opponents using various pirate-themed cards. The key difference between the digital and physical versions of the game is that players are unable to see their opponent’s cards, making it difficult to strategize during gameplay. </p>
<p>Captain’s Bounty was released on Steam on March 8th, 2019, where it was met with negative reviews from users. Players found the game difficult to understand and frustrating due to a lack of direction from the developers. One user stated: “There isn’t even an instruction booklet for this thing! I’m so lost”. </p>
<p>It seems that BitBucket Games did not take into account how players would interact with the digital version of Captain’s Bounty when compared to its physical predecessor. Because there was no clear way to play the game - and no instructions from the developers - players were left feeling lost and confused about how they were supposed to progress.</p>
<h1 id="Captain’s-Bounty-avoids-classification-as-gambling-game"><a href="#Captain’s-Bounty-avoids-classification-as-gambling-game" class="headerlink" title="Captain’s Bounty avoids classification as gambling game"></a>Captain’s Bounty avoids classification as gambling game</h1><p>Captain’s Bounty, a new game from developers Grey Alien Games, has hit the app stores and quickly gained popularity. But does it count as a gambling game?</p>
<p>The rules of Captain’s Bounty are simple. You are dealt a hand of cards, and then bet on which one will win the “battle.” The payout is based on the rarity of the card - with commons offering low payouts, and rares giving you the chance to win big.</p>
<p>At first glance, this would appear to be a classic case of gambling. But there are two key differences that set Captain’s Bounty apart from games like poker or blackjack.</p>
<p>First, the house never has an advantage over the player. This is because the game is designed so that each side has an equal chance of winning. Second, there is no skill involved in playing Captain’s Bounty. All you can do is bet on which card will win - you can’t influence the outcome in any way.</p>
<p>For these reasons, many experts believe that Captain’s Bounty should not be classified as a gambling game. And while some jurisdictions may disagree, it seems likely that this new title will continue to grow in popularity - especially among those who enjoy casual games with relatively low stakes.</p>
