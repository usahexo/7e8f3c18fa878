      <h1 id="James-Bond-Films-Casino-Royale-and-Quantum-of-Solace-in-Montenegro"><a href="#James-Bond-Films-Casino-Royale-and-Quantum-of-Solace-in-Montenegro" class="headerlink" title="James Bond Films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in Montenegro"></a>James Bond Films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in Montenegro</h1><p>The new James Bond film Casino Royale, set for an international release in November of 2006, shot its final scenes in the beautiful country of Montenegro. The storyline for the new film was kept tightly under wraps, but it is known that Bond will first be seen in Montenegro, where he will face off against his arch-enemy at a casino in the town of Royale.</p>
<p>The producers of the movie chose Montenegro for its unparalleled beauty and diverse landscape. From the awe-inspiring mountains and lakes to the centuries-old architecture, Montenegro provides the perfect backdrop for a Bond movie. It is no wonder that 007 producer Barbara Broccoli described Montenegro as “the most beautiful place I have ever been.”</p>
<p>In preparation for filming, a large crew descended on Montenegro in early 2006 and began refurbishing some of the country’s older buildings to serve as locations in the movie. They also built a replica of Casino Royale in order to film the climactic scene between Bond and his nemesis.</p>
<p>The cast and crew spent six weeks filming in various locations around Montenegro, including Budva, Kotor, and Podgorica. The locals turned out to be quite enthusiastic about the filming and eagerly snapped photos of their favorite stars. Daniel Craig (James Bond), Eva Green (Vesper Lynd), Judi Dench (M), and Mathieu Amalric (Dominic Greene) all seemed to enjoy themselves during their time in Montenegro.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a breathtaking backdrop for Casino Royale, Montenegro may also have a bit of extra publicity due to its connection with Quantum of Solace. This upcoming James Bond film is set to be released less than two months after Casino Royale, and it is rumored that parts of it will be filmed in Montenegro as well. So if you’re looking for an amazing travel destination with a touch of Hollywood glamour, look no further than beautiful Montenegro!</p>
<h1 id="Martin-Scorsese’s-Casino-filmed-at-the-Riviera-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Martin-Scorsese’s-Casino-filmed-at-the-Riviera-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Martin Scorsese’s Casino filmed at the Riviera in Las Vegas"></a>Martin Scorsese’s Casino filmed at the Riviera in Las Vegas</h1><p>In 1995, Martin Scorsese’s film “Casino” was filmed at the Riviera in Las Vegas. The movie tells the true story of the rise and fall of mobsters Anthony “The Ant” Spilotro and Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal. The cast and crew spent six months filming at the Riviera, and many of the scenes were shot on location inside the casino.</p>
<p>The Riviera was one of the first resorts in Las Vegas to welcome Hollywood filmmakers, and it played host to a number of classic movies over the years, including Ocean’s Eleven, The Hangover, and Casino Royale. The resort closed its doors for good in 2015, but its legacy lives on in these iconic films.</p>
<h1 id="Steven-Soderbergh’s-Oceans-Eleven-and-its-sequels-filmed-at-various-casinos-around-the-world"><a href="#Steven-Soderbergh’s-Oceans-Eleven-and-its-sequels-filmed-at-various-casinos-around-the-world" class="headerlink" title="Steven Soderbergh’s Oceans Eleven and its sequels filmed at various casinos around the world"></a>Steven Soderbergh’s Oceans Eleven and its sequels filmed at various casinos around the world</h1><p>With the release of ‘Oceans Eleven’ in 2001, director Steven Soderbergh created a film that redefined the heist movie genre. The star-studded cast – which included George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts – filmed at various casinos around the world, including the Bellagio in Las Vegas and the robber-friendly Ritz in Paris.</p>
<p>The movie’s $85 million budget was dwarfed by its box office earnings of over $450 million, leading to two sequels: ‘Oceans Twelve’ in 2004 and ‘Oceans Thirteen’ in 2007. While filming at the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, thieves robbed the actor Andy Garcia of $250,000 worth of jewelry. In response, production staff installed security cameras and alarms throughout the casino.</p>
<p>The success of the Oceans trilogy has led many other movies to film at casinos around the world. In 2012, ‘21 Jump Street’ filmed at Harrah’s casino in Lake Tahoe; while 2013’s ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ did some scenes at the Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Casinos have capitalized on their Hollywood fame by hosting movie premieres and other special events. In 2004, shortly after ‘Oceans Twelve’ premiered in Las Vegas, Caesars Palace hosted an exhibit called “Hollywood: Where Dreams are Made.” The exhibit displayed costumes, props and sets from popular movies filmed at casinos, including ‘Ocean’s Eleven,’ ‘Rain Man,’ and ‘Bugsy.’</p>
<h1 id="The-Hangover-films-mostly-filmed-in-the-Bellagio-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#The-Hangover-films-mostly-filmed-in-the-Bellagio-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="The Hangover films mostly filmed in the Bellagio in Las Vegas"></a>The Hangover films mostly filmed in the Bellagio in Las Vegas</h1><p>The “Hangover” movies have mostly been filmed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. The first film in the series was released in 2009 and took place mainly at the Bellagio with some scenes also shot at the nearby Mirage and Luxor resorts. </p>
<p>The second film, released in 2011, was set mainly in Bangkok, Thailand but there were a few scenes filmed at the Bellagio. The third and final movie, released in 2013, was set mainly in Los Angeles but there were also a few scenes filmed at the Bellagio. </p>
<p>The setting of the luxurious Bellagio hotel has been a key factor in making the Hangover movies so popular. The hotel’s opulent interior and its spectacular fountains have made it a favourite location for filming movies and TV shows.</p>
<h1 id="ITV’s-Gladiators-was-filmed-at-the-London-casino-Crockfords"><a href="#ITV’s-Gladiators-was-filmed-at-the-London-casino-Crockfords" class="headerlink" title="ITV’s Gladiators was filmed at the London casino Crockfords"></a>ITV’s Gladiators was filmed at the London casino Crockfords</h1><p>The popular ITV show Gladiators was filmed at the world-famous London casino Crockfords. The show, which ran from 1992 until 2000, was hosted by Ulrika Jonsson and John Fashanu, and saw teams of two contestants go head-to-head against Gladiators in a series of physical challenges.</p>
<p>The Crockfords casino provided the perfect backdrop for the show, with its grandiose interiors and luxurious surroundings. The casino is located in Mayfair, one of the most affluent areas of London, and is a popular destination for high-rollers and VIPs.</p>
<p>Crockfords is one of the oldest casinos in Europe, having first opened its doors in 1828. It’s been owned by the Genting Group since 1967, and has played host to some of the biggest names in gambling over the years. In fact, it’s said that Crockfords is where poker was first played as a betting game!</p>
<p>If you want to experience some of the luxury that Crockfords has to offer, then be sure to check out their casino floor. You can try your hand at Blackjack, Roulette or Poker, or simply sit back and watch the action unfold. There’s also a wide range of slot machines on offer if you’re feeling lucky!</p>
