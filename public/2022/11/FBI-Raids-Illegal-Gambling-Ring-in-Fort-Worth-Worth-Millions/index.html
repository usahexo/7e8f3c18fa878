The raid took place on Wednesday morning and involved agents from the FBI, the IRS, and the Fort Worth Police Department.</p>
<p>The gambling ring was allegedly run by a group of six people who are believed to have made millions of dollars from illegal betting. The suspects are all believed to be from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>
<p>Agents seized over $200,000 in cash, as well as computers and other evidence from the raid. They also arrested four people who were allegedly involved in running the gambling ring.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that authorities have cracked down on an illegal gambling ring in Fort Worth. In February 2017, a dozen people were arrested for running an illegal cockfighting ring in the city.</p>
