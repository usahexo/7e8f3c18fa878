      <h1 id="Casino-Pier-to-Reopen-in-2022"><a href="#Casino-Pier-to-Reopen-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Casino Pier to Reopen in 2022!"></a>Casino Pier to Reopen in 2022!</h1><p>Casino Pier, a staple of the Jersey Shore for over a century, has been closed since Hurricane Sandy ravaged the boardwalk in October 2012. After a long and costly renovation, the pier is scheduled to reopen in 2022.</p>
<p>The iconic amusement park was decimated by the storm surge and high winds, causing extensive damage to the pier and its rides. The Casino Pier team has been working tirelessly to rebuild what was lost, and they are excited to finally reopen their doors to the public.</p>
<p>There will be new and returning rides at Casino Pier, including the popular Hurricane roller coaster. The pier will also have a Kyle’s Kritters petting zoo and a carousel.</p>
<p>In addition to the rides, there will be food trucks and concessions available on the pier. Admission is free, but there will be fees for some of the rides.</p>
<p> Casino Pier is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Jersey Shore, and its reopening is sure to bring crowds of people from all over. So mark your calendars – Casino Pier will be open for business again in 2022!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Pier-Construction-Finally-Finished-Opening-Day-Set-for-2022"><a href="#Casino-Pier-Construction-Finally-Finished-Opening-Day-Set-for-2022" class="headerlink" title="Casino Pier Construction Finally Finished - Opening Day Set for 2022"></a>Casino Pier Construction Finally Finished - Opening Day Set for 2022</h1><p>It has been a long and arduous journey, but the Casino Pier construction is finally completed. The opening day has been set for June 13th, 2022.</p>
<p>The reconstruction project began in March of 2020 after a major fire destroyed much of the pier. The new Casino Pier is now twice as large as the original, with a total of 32 amusement rides and attractions.</p>
<p>There are several new additions to the pier, including a record-breaking roller coaster called “The Thunderbolt”. This coaster reaches speeds of up to 95 miles per hour and features a 90-degree drop!</p>
<p>Other new attractions include a log flume ride, bumper cars, and a pirate ship ride. There are also several kiddie rides for younger visitors.</p>
<p>In addition to the amusement rides, the pier features numerous shops and restaurants. There is something for everyone at Casino Pier!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Pier-Days-Away-From-Opening-Get-Excited"><a href="#Casino-Pier-Days-Away-From-Opening-Get-Excited" class="headerlink" title="Casino Pier Days Away From Opening - Get Excited!"></a>Casino Pier Days Away From Opening - Get Excited!</h1><p>Unless you have been living under a rock, Casino Pier in Seaside Heights has been in the process of rebuilding since Hurricane Sandy pummeled the Jersey Shore in October 2012. The iconic amusement pier, which dates back to the 1920s and was featured in MTV’s “The Jersey Shore” reality series, sustained massive damage from the hurricane and ensuing storm surge.</p>
<p>After years of hard work and millions of dollars invested, Casino Pier is finally ready to reopen! The amusement park will be kicking off the summer season on Memorial Day weekend with new rides, games, and food options. There’s even a new arcade called Game Time!</p>
<p>Among the new rides is Hydrus, a family raft ride that takes guests through a serpentine course of twists and turns. Other new rides include The Himalaya, a classic steel roller coaster; Hullabaloo, a swings ride that takes passengers high into the air; and Riptide Racer, a water slide that sends riders speeding down four stories.</p>
<p>In addition to the new rides, the pier has also undergone a major renovation. The old carousel has been replaced with a state-of-the-art LED carousel, there are now more food options including an ice cream shop and pizza place, and there’s even a beach bar for those who want to take in some sun while enjoying a cold drink.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get excited for Casino Pier’s reopening this Memorial Day weekend!</p>
<h1 id="Countdown-to-the-Reopening-of-Casino-Pier-Begins"><a href="#Countdown-to-the-Reopening-of-Casino-Pier-Begins" class="headerlink" title="Countdown to the Reopening of Casino Pier Begins!"></a>Countdown to the Reopening of Casino Pier Begins!</h1><p>The Casino Pier amusement park has been closed since the devastating hurricane Sandy swept through the Jersey Shore in October of 2012. However, plans are now in motion to reopen the pier by Memorial Day weekend this year!</p>
<p>Workers have been hard at work repairing the damages that were done to the pier and its rides. Governor Christie himself has come out in support of the reopening, saying that it will bring much-needed tourism dollars to the area.</p>
<p>There is still some work that needs to be done before the pier can open, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing a new electric panel</li>
<li>Rebuilding the arcade</li>
<li>Repairing damage to the roof</li>
<li>Painting and rebranding the pier</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these remaining tasks, officials are confident that everything will be ready for tourists by late May. So get your summer beach gear ready - Casino Pier is coming back!</p>
<h1 id="2022-The-Year-of-Casino-Pier"><a href="#2022-The-Year-of-Casino-Pier" class="headerlink" title="2022 - The Year of Casino Pier"></a>2022 - The Year of Casino Pier</h1><p>In 2022, Casino Pier will celebrate its 100-year anniversary. The amusement park has been a staple of the Jersey Shore for generations, and it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>The pier has something for everyone, from classic amusement park rides like the Ferris wheel and tilt-a-whirl to more modern attractions like the laser maze and virtual reality roller coaster. There’s also a wide array of restaurants and bars, plus a sprawling boardwalk with plenty of shops and games.</p>
<p>Casino Pier is a family-friendly destination, but that doesn’t mean it’s just for kids. Adults can enjoy the arcade or go on a romantic stroll by the ocean. And there’s no better place to take in the sunset than from the top of the pier’s observation tower.</p>
<p> 2022 will be a big year for Casino Pier. Not only is it celebrating its centennial, but it’s also debuting several new rides and attractions. So if you’re looking for some summer fun, make sure to visit Casino Pier!</p>
