# What are the different payouts?

The different payouts vary depending on the type of bet that is placed, but some of the most common ones include:

* 1-18 or 19-36 - These are the odds for betting on either black or red, odd or even, or high (1-19) or low (20-36) numbers. These bets typically pay out even money, which means that you will get your original wager back plus an additional amount equal to your original wager if you win. For example, if you wager $10 on black and it comes up black, you will receive $10 back plus another $10, for a total return of $20.

These bets typically pay out 2-1, which means that you will receive twice your original wager if you win. For example, if you wager $10 on first dozen and it comes up as 2nd dozen instead, you would receive $20 back ($10 original stake plus $10 profit).
