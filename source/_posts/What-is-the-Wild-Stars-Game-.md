#  What is the Wild Stars Game? 
The Wild Stars game was created by the software development company, Neocore Games. It is a browser-based massively multiplayer online game that was first released in Europe in February of 2017. The game is set in a science fiction world and allows players to control their own space ship, make allies, and battle rivals.

The game has three different modes: story mode, co-operative mode, and competitive mode. In story mode, players are able to follow a storyline that was written by an award-winning science fiction author. They can also choose to explore the world on their own or with friends in co-operative mode. Competitive mode pits players against each other in timed battles for resources and domination over the map. 

Players can choose from one of four races in the game: humans, elves, orcs, or undead. They can also choose from one of six classes: fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, wizard, or shaman. Each class has its own unique abilities that allow players to customize their gameplay experience.

The Wild Stars game is free to play but offers different premium services that players can purchase with real money. These services include things like increased inventory space, bonus experience points, and access to better gear. However, the developers have stated that they will never sell items that give players an advantage over others who do not purchase them. 

# What Makes The Wild Stars Game Unique? 
One of the things that makes the Wild Stars game unique is its use of an award-winning science fiction author's storyline. Players are able to follow the story as it unfolds or explore it on their own. Additionally, each race in the game has its own unique abilities and classes which allow for a great deal of customization. 

The Wild Stars game is also free to play with no purchases required for an advantage over other players. The developers have said that they will never sell items that give players an unfair advantage so all players are on a level playing field. This makes the game fair for all who want to compete and discourages spending money unnecessarily.
