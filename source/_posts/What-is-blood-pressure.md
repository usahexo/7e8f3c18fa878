#  What is blood pressure?

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries. When heart contracts, it pumps blood (containing oxygen and nutrients) out to organs and tissues. Blood pressure is highest when the heart contracts and pushes the blood forward. It is lowest when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. 

The artery walls stretch and then recoil as the blood is pushed out. This push and pull creates a pulsing pressure or wave which travels through arteries at the speed of sound. The highest point of the wave is called systolic blood pressure while the lowest point is called diastolic pressure. 

Blood pressure varies from person to person, depending on age, health, and other factors. Generally, lower blood pressures are healthier than higher pressures. Normal blood pressure for an adult is below 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure above this level may increase your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other problems. 

There are many things that can affect blood pressure, including diet, exercise, stress, weight, smoking, and alcohol use. 

# What are the causes of high blood pressure?
There are many things that can cause high blood pressure including: narrowing or hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), hormones, genetics, being overweight or obese, eating too much salt (sodium), drinking too much alcohol, stress, not enough exercise, and having kidney disease.

#  What are the risk factors for high blood pressure?

There are a number of risk factors for high blood pressure, including obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Genetics can also play a role in developing hypertension.

High blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. It is important to be aware of the risk factors for high blood pressure and to take steps to reduce your risk of developing this condition.

#  What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?

If you have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, you may not have any symptoms. This is why it's important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.

When symptoms do occur, they can include:

· Headache
· Dizziness
· Blurred vision
· Nausea
· Shortness of breath
There are a few things that you can do to help control your blood pressure if it is high. These include:

· Eating a healthy diet
· Exercising regularly
· Maintaining a healthy weight
· Limiting your intake of sodium

#  How can I monitor my own blood pressure at home?

There are many ways that you can monitor your own blood pressure at home. You can use an automatic blood pressure cuff, which is a device that wraps around your arm and takes a reading automatically. You can also use a manual blood pressure cuff, which you have to pump up yourself.

Whichever method you choose, it's important to take readings at the same time every day and to keep track of them over time. This will help you see any patterns in your blood pressure and whether or not it is changing over time.

If you are using an automatic cuff, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for taking a reading. Generally, you will need to:

Wrap the cuff around your arm so that the bottom of the cuff is just above your elbow and the top of the cuff is two inches below your armpit
8. Place the index and middle fingers of your other hand on top of the pulse point on your brachial artery (the artery on the inside of your arm, just below your elbow) 
9. Turn on the machine and wait until it beeps
10. The machine will start inflating the cuff automatically. When it beeps again, this means the cuff has reached its maximum size and it is time to take the reading 
11. The machines then starts deflating the cuff and when it beeps for a third time, this means the reading is complete 
12. Write down both numbers (the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure) that are displayed on the screen
13. Repeat steps 8-12 for each reading

#  Are there any risks associated with self-monitoring my blood pressure at home?

Self-monitoring your blood pressure at home is a safe and effective way to manage your blood pressure. It allows you to track your blood pressure readings over time and make changes to your treatment plan as needed.

There are a few things to keep in mind when self-monitoring your blood pressure at home. First, always use an appropriate sized cuff and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. It is also important to take multiple readings and average them together to get the most accurate reading. If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to speak with your doctor.
