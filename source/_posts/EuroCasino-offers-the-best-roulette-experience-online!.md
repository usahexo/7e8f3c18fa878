# How to play Roulette

Roulette is a casino game that is popular all over the world. The game is played on a table with a spinning wheel, and players bet on where they think the ball will land. There are many different types of bets that can be made, and the payout depends on the odds of each bet.

# How to find your lucky number

There is no one sure way to pick a winning number at Roulette, but some players advocate picking a number that is significant to you. You could also pick a number that has appeared often in recent spins, or choose one that is opposite of another number you fancy. Whichever method you choose, make sure you are comfortable with your choice and stick with it!

# Placing your bets

To place a bet, first decide how much money you want to wager. Then select the chip size that corresponds with that amount of money. For example, if you want to bet €10, select a €10 chip from the betting table. There are different coloured chips for each amount so make sure you select the right one! Next, move your cursor over the bet you want to make and click on it. Your chip will then be placed on the betting grid next to your chosen number.

# The Different Types of Bets

There are many different types of bets that can be made at Roulette, and each has its own payout odds. Here are some of the most common ones:

- Straight up: Betting on a single number, with odds of 35-1. This is usually a risky bet but has the potential for large payouts.


- Split: Betting on two adjacent numbers on the betting grid, with odds of 17-1. This is a safer bet than betting on a single number but has smaller payouts.

- Street: Betting on three numbers in a row on the betting grid, with odds of 11-1. This is also a safer bet than betting on a single number, but has smaller payouts than other options.

- Corner: Betting on four numbers that form a square on the betting grid, with odds of 8-1 . This is another safe option which offers slightly lower payouts than some other bets available.

- Six Line: Betting on six numbers that form two rows of three numbers each on the betting grid,with odds of 5-1 . This is another relatively safe option which offers better payouts than some other choices available at Roulette tables
