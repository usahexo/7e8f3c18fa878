#  6 Deck Blackjack Without Splitting or Surrendering is Still a Fun Game!

It’s not as though the casino can have too much of an edge on us. It would be like saying that we should all stop playing because the casino has too big of an advantage.

The basic game of blackjack is unbeatable for the player. No matter what the composition of the cards, the house edge is fixed at just under 1 percent provided you stick to basic strategy. But if you add in splitting and surrendering your options increase, as does the house edge.

That said, there are still plenty of players who enjoy playing blackjack without splitting or surrendering. If you fall into this category, I have some good news for you: You can still find a fun and entertaining game of blackjack without giving up any advantage to the casino!

In this article, we’re going to take a look at six different blackjack games that don’t require splitting or surrendering. We’ll also take a look at the house edge for each game so that you can see how much better off you are by avoiding these optional plays.

First up is Atlantic City Blackjack. This game is played with eight decks of cards and features dealer peek, which allows the dealer to look at his hole card to see if he has a blackjack. The house edge for Atlantic City Blackjack is 0.39 percent.

Next up is Vegas Strip Blackjack. This game is also played with eight decks of cards and features dealer peek, but it also includes some other rules that make it more advantageous for the player. Specifically, doubling down on any two cards is allowed, and players may split any pair except pairs of 2s through 4s. The house edge for Vegas Strip Blackjack drops down to 0.28 percent.

Third on our list is Double Exposure Blackjack. This game is also played with eight decks of cards, but in Double Exposure Blackjack both dealer cards are dealt face up. This increases the house edge to 1.65 percent.

Fourth up is Spanish 21 Blackjack. Unlike all of the games we’ve looked at so far, Spanish 21 Blackjack is played with only six decks of cards instead of eight decks (or more). This decreases the house edge slightly to 0.46 percent, but it also comes with a few other rules changes that make it more advantageous for the player – namely that players may double down on any number of cards and re-split pairs up to four times (instead of just twice).

Fifth on our list is Super Fun 21 Blackjack. This game is also played with six decks of cards, but like Spanish 21 Blackjack it comes with a few rule changes that make it more favourable for the player; specifically, players can split any pair (even if they are not matched), they can double down on any two cards, and blackjacks pay out at 3-to-2 instead of 1-to-1 . These rule changes decrease the house edge from 0 .64 percent down to 0 .43 percent .

#  Mark Twain Would Approve of This 6 Deck Blackjack Strategy!

When it comes to gambling, Mark Twain was one of the most well-known and respected American authors of all time. In 1892, he published an article in the Atlantic Monthly entitled “The Science of Gambling” which discussed games of chance such as roulette, faro, and poker. A few years later, in 1907, he published another article in Harper’s Magazine called “CardSharping” which covered cheating methods used by card sharks.

Given Twain’s background and knowledge on the subject matter, it’s no surprise that he would be a big proponent of blackjack strategy. And in fact, he was! In his book “Life on the Mississippi”, he provides a detailed description of how to beat the game using a six deck strategy.

Although times have changed and casino rules have become more complicated, the basic principles underlying Twain’s strategy are still valid today. Let’s take a look at what they are!

1. Always split pairs of Aces and 8s.

2. Never split pairs of 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s.

3. Split pairs of 6s through 10s if the dealer is showing a card worth 10 or more points (e.g., a 3, 4, 5, or 6). Otherwise, keep them together.

4. If the dealer shows an Ace as their upcard, hit if you have 13 points or less; stand if you have 14 points or more.

5. Double down on 11 points only (never double down with 12 points).

6. When the dealer has a 2 as their upcard, take insurance if your first two cards total 20 points or more (e.g., Ace-Queen). Insurance pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (a natural).

#  No Surrender or Splitting in 6 Deck Blackjack? That's Still Fair Play!

The game of blackjack pits dealer against player in an effort to get as close to 21 as possible, without going bust. The key to success is making smart decisions during the game, and counting cards can give you an advantage.

While some players advocate for no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack, doing so reduces the chances of a fair game. Keep reading to learn more about why surrendering or splitting in this situation can be a bad decision.

When it comes to playing blackjack, some players advocate for no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack games. However, doing so can actually reduce the chances of having a fair game.

Here's why: when you surrender or split in this situation, you are essentially giving up your opportunity to win the hand. This can be costly, especially if the dealer has a strong hand.

Instead of surrendering or splitting, it's best to wait for better hands and make smart decisions throughout the course of the game. This will increase your chances of winning and ensure that you have a fair game.

#  Playing 6 Deck Blackjack Without Splitting or SurrenderingStill Provides Plenty of Excitement!

There are a few different variations of blackjack that can be played, but the most popular is the standard game where players are dealt two cards and then must make a decision on what to do with those cards. One option is to stand which means to keep the cards as they are and not receive any more. Another choice is to hit, which means taking another card in order to try and reach a total of 21 or closer to it. If somebody goes over 21, then they have busted and lose automatically. The last option is to split, which is when you are dealt two cards of the same value and can choose to create two hands instead of one. Finally, there is the option of surrendering which can only be done if the player has been dealt two cards of the same value (and not including an Ace).

Surrendering isn't available in every casino, so if you're looking for a 6 deck blackjack game that doesn't let you surrender then don't worry - there are still plenty of other options out there! For example, some casinos will offer games that allow players to split up to four times (as opposed to just twice in a regular game). This can provide plenty of excitement, especially if your first two cards are both 10s or face cards since you'll have four chances to win rather than just two.

Another variation on 6 deck blackjack without surrendering that's becoming increasingly popular is Double Exposure Blackjack. In this game, both dealer's cards are shown at the beginning of the hand. This essentially gives players a 50/50 chance of winning since they can see what the dealer has and make decisions accordingly. There are other variations out there too, so it's worth checking out a few different ones before settling on one particular game.

Whichever type of blackjack you choose to play, remember that having fun is always more important than winning or losing money. So relax, enjoy yourself, and good luck!

#  Enjoy 6 Deck Blackjack With No Surrender or Splitting If You Prefer

There are different blackjack variations that offer different gameplay experiences. If you're looking for a variation that doesn't have surrender or splitting, then 6 deck blackjack is a great option. This game variant is played with 6 decks of cards, which gives players more opportunities to form winning hands.

In order to play 6 deck blackjack, you'll need to find a table that offers it. Many online casinos offer this game variant, so finding a place to play is not difficult. Once you've found a table, take a seat and begin placing your bets. The minimum bet in most casinos will be $5, but this can vary depending on the casino.

The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. You'll receive two cards face up, and the dealer will receive two cards - one face up and one face down. You can then choose to hit (take another card), stand (end your turn), or double down (double your bet and receive one more card). If you go over 21, you lose automatically.

Since there is no surrender or splitting in 6 deck blackjack, the best strategy is to always hit until you reach 17 or greater. The only time you would want to stand is if the dealer has a poor upcard (2 through 6). By following this strategy, you'll give yourself the best chance of winning while minimising the risk of going bust.
