#  NFL reverses gambling stance; allows Las Vegas Raiders

The NFL announced Wednesday that it has reversed its longtime stance against gambling and will now allow the Raiders to move to Las Vegas.

Commissioner Roger Goodell said the decision was made in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling overturning a federal ban on sports betting.

"We believe that today's ruling will ultimately enhance the NFL's fan experience across all of our platforms," Goodell said in a statement. "As it was with legalized gambling in other leagues, we will work closely with our clubs to ensure that our fans have a positive experience when they bet on NFL games."

Raiders owner Mark Davis had been seeking permission to move his team to Las Vegas for several years, but the NFL had been reluctant to approve the move due to its opposition to gambling.

The Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020.

#  NFL changes stance on gambling, approves Patriots move to Las Vegas

The NFL approved the Patriots' move to Las Vegas on Tuesday, a day after changing its stance on gambling.

Las Vegas has long been seen as a potential home for an NFL team, with its numerous casinos and hotels. But the league had been reluctant to approve a team moving there because of the city's gaming industry.

Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday that the league's position on gambling had changed. "The NFL's policy is that gambling is not good for our sport," he said. "We're not changing our policy."

But Goodell went on to say that the league would now allow teams to move to cities where gambling is legal. "What we've done is taken a fresh look at it and determined that if a team wants to go to a market where there are legalized sports betting, that we will allow them to do so," he said.

The Patriots immediately became the front-runners to move to Las Vegas, and the team's owner, Robert Kraft, said he was interested in moving the team there. "I think it's really important for us to explore this opportunity," Kraft said.

The Raiders have also expressed interest in moving to Las Vegas, and their proposal for a new stadium was approved by the Nevada Legislature earlier this year. But the Raiders have yet to reach an agreement with casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million toward building the stadium.

#  NFL gambles on gambling by allowing Raiders and Bills to relocate to Las Vegas

 NFL owners voted 31-1 on Monday to allow the Oakland Raiders andBuffalo Bills to relocate to Las Vegas, a move that could have major implicationsfor the future of gambling in the United States.

The Raiders will move to Vegas in time for the 2020 season, whilethe Bills will relocate in 2021. The moves were approved despite concernsfrom some owners about the potential for betting scandals.

"The NFL is confident that it has in place a strong integrityprogram that will protect the game and its fans," NFL commissionerRoger Goodell said in a statement following the vote.

Las Vegas has long been seen as an attractive destination forprofessional sports teams, thanks to the city's numerous casinos andhotels. The Raiders had been searching for a new home since theirformer owner, Al Davis, died in 2011.

The Bills have been playing at Buffalo's Ralph Wilson Stadiumsince 1965, but team owner Terry Pegula has been looking for alocation closer to his home in upstate New York.

NFL teams have been increasingly interested in moving to LasVegas in recent years, as the city has moved to legalize gambling onsporting events. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law thatprevented states from legalizing sports betting, opening up a newmarket for casino operators.

Casino companies like MGM Resorts International and CaesarsEntertainment Corp are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries ofthe ruling, and they are already preparing for a surge in interest incasinobetting on football games.

#  After long opposition to gambling, NFL approves Raiders' move to Las Vegas

The National Football League has approved the Oakland Raiders' move to Las Vegas. The vote was close, but it was passed 31-1. This is a major victory for the gambling industry, as it will now be home to America's most popular sport.

Many people have spoken out against the move, saying that it is wrong to reward a city that is built on gambling. There are also concerns about the impact that this will have on the players and staff of the Raiders.

Others argue that this is simply a business decision, and that the NFL is simply trying to expand its brand into new markets. Gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this is a chance for the NFL to get in on the action.

It remains to be seen how well this move will work out for the Raiders. They are already a small-market team, and moving to Las Vegas is only going to make things more difficult for them. It will be interesting to see how they fare in their new home

#  In reversal, NFL approves Raiders' move to Las Vegas after years of opposing gambling

The NFL Owners meeting on Monday, March 27th will long be remembered as the day that the longstanding opposition to gambling by the NFL Owners was reversed, approving the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas.

This move has been in the works for over a year, as Raiders’ owner Mark Davis has been seeking a new stadium for his team. The problem is that there is not much available land in Oakland to build a stadium, and so he started looking elsewhere. He found an opportunity in Las Vegas, where casino magnate Sheldon Adelson offered to help finance a new stadium.

However, one of the conditions of this deal was that the stadium be used for other events and not just football games. This presented a problem for the NFL, as their opposition to gambling is based on the belief that it could lead to Corruption of Sport. As a result, they initially refused to approve the move.

It appears that Adelson may have played a role in changing the NFL’s mind however. He withdrew his offer to help finance the stadium after the NFL refused to approve the move, and it is possible that this had an effect on some of the more conservative NFL Owners. They may have realized that they were going to lose out on a lucrative deal if they did not approve the move.

Whatever the reason, on Monday they reversed their decision and approved the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas. It will be interesting to see how this affects their popularity among fans, many of whom are opposed to gambling.
