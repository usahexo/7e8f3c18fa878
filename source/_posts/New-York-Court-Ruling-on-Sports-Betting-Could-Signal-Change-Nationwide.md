#  New York Court Ruling on Sports Betting Could Signal Change Nationwide

On May 14, 2018, the US Supreme Court declined to hear New Jersey’s case to legalize sports betting, thereby upholding a lower court’s ruling that the state’s law permitting such betting violates federal law. However, in a separate case also decided on that day, the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on gambling on tribal land, paving the way for states to negotiate individual agreements with tribes over sports betting.

What does this mean for sports bettors and the gaming industry?

The most immediate impact is that Nevada and Delaware are now the only states where single-game wagering is legal. Sports fans in other states will continue to illegally place bets with bookmakers, offshore operators, and sometimes even their friends.

But there is potential for broader change. The overturning of the federal ban on gambling on tribal land opens up the possibility for states to enter into compacts with tribes, allowing for regulated sports betting within their borders. So far, four states have already begun negotiations with tribes regarding sports betting: Pennsylvania, Michigan, California, and Mississippi.

It remains to be seen which states will take up this opportunity and what form regulation will take. Some lawmakers are pushing for a model similar to that of Nevada, where only casinos can offer sports betting. Others favor a more liberal approach like in Great Britain, where any licensed bookmaker can offer bets. The devil will be in the details as legislatures debate the many complex issues surrounding regulation: tax rates, licensing requirements, age limits, game restrictions, and so on.

There is also the question of whether Congress will try to step in and pass national legislation governing sports betting. This appears unlikely at this point but cannot be ruled out entirely.

The potential implications of all this uncertainty are far-reaching. The gaming industry stands to gain billions of dollars in revenue if more states legalize sports betting. But there are also concerns about its social ills: addiction, money laundering, corruption of young people. It will be important for legislators to strike a balance between promoting economic development and protecting public health and safety.

At issue is nothing less than who controls our leisure activities – government or private interests? And how much should we pay to enjoy them? Sports betting has been around since ancient times but has been largely confined to illegal underground markets in recent decades. With legalization comes questions about what sort of regulations should apply and who should benefit from the new revenue streams it generates. Fans of legalized gambling argue that it is simply another form of entertainment like movies or concerts and should be taxed and regulated similarly. Critics counter that it is a menace to society that preys on addictive personalities and leads to crime and corruption.

The debate over legalizing sports betting is heating up around the country as more states consider how they want to proceed. It is certain to be one of the most contentious issues facing state legislatures in years to come.

#  New York Sports Betting Upheld by Appeals Court

The New York State Court of Appeals upheld the state's ban on sports betting on Tuesday, dealing a blow to the hopes of fans who want to wager on their favorite teams.

The court ruled that a 2013 law that banned sports betting in New York is constitutional. That law was passed in the wake of a federal decision that allowed states to legalize sports betting if they chose to do so.

New York is one of six states that have not legalized some form of sports betting.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo applauded the ruling, saying it would help protect the integrity of sporting events.

"I applaud the Court for upholding New York's longtime ban on sports betting, which protects the integrity of our sporting events and helps to prevent gambling addiction," Cuomo said in a statement.

The governor has long opposed legalizing sports betting in New York, saying it could lead to corruption in sporting events. He has also said that it could lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling.

But critics argue that the state is losing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue by not legalizing sports betting. They also say that it is hypocritical for New York to allow casinos and racetracks but not allow people to bet on sports at those venues.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say it would generate new revenue for the state and create jobs. They also argue that it would give people another way to enjoy sporting events.

The appeals court ruling is likely the final word on the matter, as there is no chance that the state Legislature will pass a bill legalizing sports betting anytime soon.

# Sports Gambling Now Legal in New York After Long Battle

Associated Press

ALBANY, N.Y. — After a long and arduous battle, sports gambling is now legal in New York. The state's Gaming Commission voted unanimously on Thursday to approve regulations that will allow for wagering on events both within and outside of the state.

"At long last, sports gambling is becoming a reality in New York," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. "This is an important day for the Empire State, and I applaud the Gaming Commission for its hard work in helping us achieve this goal."

Legalized sports gambling had been a top priority for Cuomo, who pushed for it in his annual budget proposals. In May, lawmakers approved a bill that allows bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at up to four casinos and on mobile devices.

The regulations approved Thursday lay out the parameters for how sports betting will operate in New York, including how much operators can charge for bets, how much people can wager and what types of sporting events can be wagered on. The regulations also require bettors to be at least 21 years old and establish rules prohibiting employees of casinos and other gambling establishments from betting on sporting events.

States across the country have been moving to legalize sports gambling following a landmark Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the practice. Pennsylvania became the first state to offer legal sports betting outside of Nevada when it launched its system in November. New Jersey, which won the court case that overturned the federal ban, has since become one of the largest markets for legal sports betting.

#  New York Becomes Fourth State to Legalize Sports Betting

The New York State Gaming Commission voted on Wednesday to legalize sports betting in the state, making it the fourth state in the nation to do so. The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month.

“This is a historic day for New York as we strike down another outdated prohibition and join the growing number of states that are allowing our citizens to engage in this popular form of entertainment,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)” said Governor Andrew Cuomo in a statement.

Under the new regulations, sports betting will be allowed at up to four casinos and online through the state’s gaming commission website. Wagering will be restricted to people over 21 years old and will not be allowed on collegiate or amateur events.

New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia were the first states to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court decision. Pennsylvania is expected to follow suit shortly.

#  New York Opens Door for Sports Betting as Other States Mull Options

New York has finally decided to move ahead with legalizing sports betting, following in the footsteps of a number of other states. This could mean big profits for the state, as well as for sports teams and players.

But what are the details of this new law, and how will it work? Here’s a look at what New Yorkers can expect.

First, let’s take a quick look at how sports betting works. In most cases, people bet on games by choosing one side or the other – for example, they might bet that the Celtics will beat the Lakers. If their team ends up winning, they collect their winnings; if their team loses, they lose their stake.

There are also various types of “prop bets” that can be made – for example, you might place a wager on how many points LeBron James will score in a game. This type of bet is a bit more complicated, as it depends on multiple factors such as the teams involved and the odds given by bookmakers.

Now that New York has legalized sports betting, people in the state will be able to place wagers both online and at physical locations. The state has already awarded licenses to eight casinos, which will be able to offer sports betting services starting July 15th. There are also plans to allow mobile betting in the near future.

So far, there haven’t been any official announcements about what types of bets will be available – this information is likely still being finalized. However, we can expect that most major sporting events will be available for wagering. It’s also likely that bets will be offered on college games (although not high school games), as well as professional games from all major leagues including the NFL, MLB and NBA.

One thing that is still unclear is how much tax New York will charge on gambling winnings. The state has proposed a tax rate of 8%, but this may change before the law goes into effect. Casino operators are also pushing for a lower tax rate, so it remains to be seen what kind of agreement can be reached.

In addition to tax revenue, lawmakers are expecting that legalizing sports betting will bring in new jobs and investment from casino operators. It’s thought that this could generate around $300 million in annual gaming revenue for the state. And since New York already has legalized gambling in some form (including casinos, poker and horse racing), it was relatively easy for lawmakers to agree to legalize sports betting as well.

Other states are watching New York closely to see how things play out. Delaware and Mississippi have already moved ahead with legalizing sports betting, while several other states are considering similar measures. This is largely due to a Supreme Court ruling last year which struck down a federal law that banned sports betting nationwide.

So far there haven’t been any major problems with implementing legalized sports betting in these states, although there have been some complaints about high taxes rates and limited options for where people can place bets. But overall it seems that this new form of gambling is here to stay – especially now that New York has joined in!
