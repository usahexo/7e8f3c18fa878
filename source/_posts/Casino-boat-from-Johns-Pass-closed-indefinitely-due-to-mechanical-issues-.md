#  Casino boat from Johns Pass closed indefinitely due to mechanical issues 

The casino boat from Johns Pass has been closed indefinitely after mechanical issues caused the boat to start taking on water.

The problem was first noticed by passengers and crew when the boat began listing to one side. The crew then attempted to correct the issue, but were unsuccessful.

This led to the captain making the decision to return to dock, where passengers were evacuated. Coast Guard crews also arrived on scene to assist.

Passengers reported that there was a large amount of water in the bottom of the boat and that it started to take on more water as they made their way back to shore.

Itâ€™s not yet clear what caused the mechanical issue, but an investigation is underway. This is the second casino boat from Johns Pass to encounter problems in as many weeks. 

In early March, a different boat had to be towed back to dock after it lost power.

#  Casino boat from Johns Pass closed after only one day of operations 

The casino boat from Johns Pass closed its doors after only one day of operations. The casino, which was docked at the Madeira Beach Municipal Marina, cited poor weather conditions as the reason for its closure.

The casino was scheduled to open at 11am on Saturday, but remained closed throughout the day. A notice on the door blamed high winds and choppy waters for the closure.

Owner of the casino, Robbie Ricker, said that he made the decision to close based on the safety of his employees and customers. He also added that he plans to reopen as soon as possible.

This is not the first time that bad weather has forced the closure of the casino boat from Johns Pass. In February of this year, high winds and waves forced the boat to close for two days.

#  Video poker leaves casino boat from Johns Pass passengers stranded 

JOHN'S PASS, Fla. - Video poker left passengers stranded on a casino boat from Johns Pass on Sunday.

The Star III casino boat was scheduled to return to the dock at 4:30 p.m., but never arrived.

"We were just waiting and waiting and waiting," said passenger Latisha Ford. "Some people were getting pretty upset."

Ford said she and her friends eventually called Uber to come pick them up.

"The captain came on the loudspeaker and said, 'Due to technical difficulties, we will not be able to return to the dock,'" she said. "And that was it."

Passengers told ABC Action News they were stuck on the boat for more than two hours with no air conditioning or lights.

The Star III is operated by Florida Gaming LLC out of Madeira Beach. The company has not responded to requests for comment. 

In October of 2017, a similar incident occurred with a different casino boat from Johns Pass leaving passengers stranded for hours.

#  Casino boat from Johns Pass shut down due to illegal gambling allegations 

The casino boat from Johns Pass has been shut down due to allegations of illegal gambling. The State of Florida released a statement saying that the casino boat was being used for illegal gambling activities, and that the company had been warned about this in the past.

This is not the first time that this particular casino boat has been in trouble. In fact, it was shut down back in 2014 due to similar allegations. It seems that the company has not learned its lesson, and has continued to engage in illegal activities.

This is bad news for the people who were using the casino boat as their source of gambling entertainment. It is also bad news for the company, which could face significant fines and penalties for its actions.

#  Casino boat from Johns Pass closes following player complaints

The casino boat from Johns Pass has been closed following numerous player complaints.

One player, who asked to remain anonymous, said, "It was just awful. The dealers were unprofessional and openly hostile. And the games were so rigged it was ridiculous."

Another player, Janice Howell, said, "I lost over $1,000 in a matter of minutes. I could tell the games were fixed and the dealers were cheating."

A spokesperson for the casino boat said that the decision to close the business was made after a meeting with the players. "We listened to their concerns and we agreed that it was best to close temporarily while we make some adjustments."
