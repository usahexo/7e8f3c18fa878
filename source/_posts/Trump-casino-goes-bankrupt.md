#  Trump casino goes bankrupt

In the early 1990s, Trump was on top of the world. He had just successfully completed the biggest casino deal in history, turning a $1 billion investment into a $3.5 billion profit. With this and other deals, he became the first ever casino operator to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

So when Trump announced plans to build the world’s largest casino in Atlantic City, there was little doubt that it would be a success. And initially, it was. The Trump Taj Mahal opened in 1990 and soon became one of the busiest casinos in town.

But as Atlantic City entered a recession in the early 2000s, business at the Trump Taj Mahal dwindled. The casino went bankrupt in 2009 and was forced to close its doors.

#  Trump casino fined for money laundering

The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has agreed to pay a $10 million fine to the federal government for money laundering.

The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said Tuesday that the casino had failed to report suspicious transactions and money laundering activity.

This is the fifth time that a Trump-owned business has been fined for such offenses. In January, Trump’s hotel and casino business in Panama was fined $48 million for similar violations.

Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the illegal activities.

#  Trump casino accused of rigging games

The Trump casino empire is once again in the news, this time accused of rigging games in its favor.

A recent lawsuit filed by a player in one of the casinos alleges that the games were rigged, and that the casino deliberately placed bets against him in order to ensure it would make money.

This is not the first time that the Trump casinos have been accused of wrongdoing. In fact, they have a long history of legal troubles, including being fined for violating gaming regulations.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations could do serious damage to his image and his businesses.

#  Trump casino closed down due to Mafia ties

In 1990, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino was shut down by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission due to its links with the Mafia.The closure cost Trump $3 million in fines and transaction costs.

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission found that Trump’s partner in the casino, the Indian-owned Resorts International, had links to Mafia boss Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno. In fact, an FBI wiretap caught Salerno boasting about his close relationship with Trump.

The closure of the Taj Mahal was a major blow to Trump’s business empire, and it contributed to his eventual bankruptcy in 1991.

#  Trump denies any wrong doing in casinos

The Trump administration has come out swinging against accusations of wrongdoing in the casinos. Several former casino workers have come forward and said that Trump and his team engaged in criminal activities to make money in the casinos.

But Trump denies all allegations, saying that he did nothing wrong and that the accusations are simply untrue. He insists that he and his team ran a clean operation and that they did everything by the book.

"These allegations are completely false," said Trump during a press conference on Wednesday. "We did nothing wrong and we acted honestly at all times. We will fight these allegations tooth and nail, and we will prevail."

This is not the first time that Trump has been accused of wrongdoing in his businesses. In the past, Trump has been accused of fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities. But he always denies any wrongdoing, insisting that he has always done things by the book.

Some people believe that Trump is guilty of these crimes, while others believe that he is being falsely accused. Only time will tell who is right.
