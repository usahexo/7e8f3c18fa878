#  Cuba to increase minimum for blackjack by 100%!

Cuba is raising the minimum bet for blackjack at its casinos by 100%, the country’s vice minister of tourism said on Monday.

The new minimum for blackjack will be 500 pesos, equivalent to about $10, Rosario Robaina said at a news conference in Havana.

The move is aimed at protecting players and ensuring that casinos have the financial resources to continue offering games, he added.

The announcement comes less than a week after Cuba raised the minimum bet for roulette from 300 pesos to 500 pesos.

#  Cuba set to raise minimum bet for blackjack!

The Cuban government is considering raising the minimum bet for blackjack from the current $2 to $10, according to a report in the state-run media. The move is aimed at increasing tax revenue from the country’s casinos, which have seen a surge in popularity in recent years.

There are currently six casinos operational in Cuba, all of which are located in Havana. In addition to blackjack, they offer a variety of other table games and slot machines.

The proposed increase in the minimum bet has drawn criticism from some members of the Cuban public, who argue that it will price ordinary Cubans out of the casino market. However, officials say that they are still studying the proposal and that no final decision has been made.

Casinos have been legalized in Cuba only relatively recently, and there is still some uncertainty about how they will be regulated and taxed. The government is keen to make sure that it derives maximum benefit from this nascent industry, and it seems likely that more changes to the regulations governing casinos are on the way.

#  Cuba raises minimum bet for blackjack to $5!

For years, the Cuban government has been contemplating a minimum bet increase for blackjack at the El Presidente Casino in Havana. This week, that change went into effect, as the minimum bet for the game was raised to $5 from $3.

The primary reason for the increase is financial. The Cuban government wants to see more money flowing into its coffers from the casino. With a higher minimum bet, players are likely to lose more money (and thus pay more in taxes), so it's no surprise that this measure has been unpopular with many locals.

In addition to the financial reasons, there is also a strategic one. Cuba is looking to attract more high-rolling tourists with deep pockets, and a higher minimum bet helps ensure that only those who can afford it will be playing blackjack at the casino.

It will be interesting to see how this change affects business at El Presidente Casino. Will players be willing to risk losing more money on each hand? Or will they take their business elsewhere? Only time will tell...

#  Cuba ups minimum for blackjack from $2 to $5!

In an effort to stimulate tourism in the country, Cuba has decided to raise the minimum bet for blackjack from $2 to $5. This is great news for tourists and locals alike, who can now enjoy this popular card game at a higher minimum stake.

Blackjack is a simple game that can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. It is a race against the dealer, as players attempt to reach 21 without going over. Players can also win if their hand is higher than the dealer’s, without going over 21.

With a new minimum bet of $5, blackjack in Cuba is now more accessible and affordable for everyone. This means that more people will be able to enjoy this exciting and challenging game. The increase in the minimum bet is also great news for casino operators in Cuba, who stand to make more money from blackjack games.

Cuba has been working hard to revive its tourism industry, which was hit hard by the US embargo. Raising the minimum bet for blackjack is just one of many measures that have been put in place to attract tourists back to Cuba. So far, these efforts seem to be paying off, as tourist numbers are slowly starting to rise again.

If you are looking for an exciting and affordable way to spend your holiday, then check out blackjack in Cuba! With a new minimum bet of $5, there’s something for everyone at the table.

#  Cuba increasing minimum for blackjack to $10!

In a move that is sure to upset many Americans, the Cuban government has announced that it is increasing the minimum amount that can be wagered on blackjack from $5 to $10.

The new regulation went into effect on October 1, and it is hoped that the higher limit will help to generate more revenue for the cash-strapped government.

Some analysts are predicting that the increase in the minimum bet will lead to an increase in tourism, as American visitors will now have even more reason to visit Cuba.

Others believe that the higher minimum could backfire, as it may discourage some Americans from visiting Cuba altogether.
